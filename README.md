# Regression of features in JAICF

## Auto Tests

Some tests are available at `./src/test` folder. They require JAICP_API_TOKEN variable set in env variables on your OS
to use CAILA or JAICP.

You can create your own project and set CAILA Access token as JAICP_API_TOKEN environmental variable. Required CAILA
project for testing is located at `./static/caila/caila_import.json`

## Manual Tests

Manual tests for channels are available in scenarios package. Feature-scenarios to test different features also
available there.
